# PowPak RMJ/RMJS → LMJ conversion attack — plan & state

**Status (2026-04-29):** Protocol RE complete, bootloader RE shows no active DeviceClass cross-check, **synth-OTA-TX builders + Phase 2a `cca ota-begin` shell command landed** (TDD against captured-on-air ground truth, all 154 firmware tests pass, ARM build clean). Awaiting hardware test for Phase 2a (subnet recon).

**Goal:** flash a non-smart PowPak (RMJ standalone for ESN, or RMJS for Vive) with smart firmware (LMJ for RA2/RA3/HWQS), entirely RF-side from a Nucleo+CC1101, bypassing every Lutron host system. End state: a device that physically exists as an RMJ/RMJS now boots as an LMJ and pairs to an RA3 processor.

## Architectural framing

The PowPak family (RMJ / RMJS / LMJ / LMQ / LMK across 434 MHz / 868 MHz variants) shares physical hardware. They differ in:

- **DeviceClass byte at LDF body offset `0x8AD`** — `0x16/0x03/0x02/0x01` for RMJ vs `0x16/0x08/0x02/0x01` for LMJ
- **Host system pairing** — RMJ pairs only to ESN, RMJS only to Vive, LMJ only to RA2/3/HWQS
- **Compiled firmware** — LMJ and RMJ `.ldf` images differ by **95.98% of bytes** (only 4.02% identical). They are NOT "same code with one byte patched"; they are separately compiled.
- **Strings** — both binaries carry the same Lutron hardware-SKU strings (`RMJ-16R-DV-B`, `RMJ-CCO1-24-B`, `RMJ-UNDEFINED`) regardless of protocol family. The "RMJ-" prefix is Lutron's hardware naming, distinct from the protocol-family designation we use elsewhere.

## What we know (RE complete)

### On-air OTA wire protocol — runtime CCA, not raw-bit (live-capture confirmed 2026-04-28..04-29)

Earlier static-RE claimed OTA used a separate raw-bit framing on a different channel. Live capture against a Caseta Pro REP2 + DVRF-6L disproved this:

- **Same channel as runtime CCA** (`433.602844 MHz`, `Project.SystemRFChannel = 26` in bridge SQLite)
- **N81 framing** with `0xFA DE` sync, CRC-16 / `0xCA0F`
- **OTA-specific packet types** ride the standard CCA framing, with sub-opcodes at body bytes 14-15

### Standard CCA packet header (bytes 2-7)

| Byte | Field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | type | `0xB1`-`0xB3` long chunk; `0x91`/`0x92` short unicast; `0x81`/`0x83` short broadcast; etc. |
| 1 | sequence | TDMA / retx counter |
| 2 | flags | `0xA0` first packet / `0xA1` retx; high nibble varies by class (0xA cmd, 0x2 state) |
| 3-4 | **subnet** | BE 16-bit, **`Project.SubnetAddress`** in bridge SQLite (`0xEFFD` for the captured Caseta) |
| 5 | pair_flag | `0x00` normal / `0x7F` during pairing |
| 6 | proto | `0x21 = QS_PROTO_RADIO_TX` |
| 7 | body length sig | `0x2B` long, `0x0E`/`0x0C`/`0x08` short variants |

The `0xC1+` response cluster has a slightly shifted layout (no sequence byte at offset 1, subnet at bytes 2-3).

### On-air sub-opcodes (bytes 14-15 = `06 nn`)

| `06 nn` | Operation | Carrier | Confirmed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `06 00` | **BeginTransfer** | `0x92` unicast | YES — payload `02 20 00 00 00 1F` (trailing `1F` = chunk size 31; leading 5 bytes' meaning open) |
| `06 01` | **ChangeAddressOffset** | `0x91` unicast | YES — payload `00 PREV 00 NEW` (16-bit BE page indices) |
| `06 02` | **TransferData** | `0xB2`/`0xB3` long (3-arm TDMA, `0xB1` rare/absent) | YES — 31-byte chunk verbatim from PFF/LDF body |
| `06 03` | **Device-poll / pre-flight** | `0x81/82/83` broadcast (DeviceClass at bytes 9-12) or `0x91/92` unicast (serial at bytes 9-12) | YES — body filler `cc cc cc cc cc cc` |

**The bootloader's dispatcher accepts MORE sub-opcodes than seen on-air:**

| Sub-op | Bootloader CALL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `02` TransferData | `CALL $009B, #$2F` | seen on-air |
| `01` ChangeAddrOff | `CALL $009A, #$F6` | seen on-air |
| `03` Poll | `CALL $009A, #$B0` | seen on-air |
| **`04` (new)** | `CALL $009B, #$CD` | NOT seen on-air — likely EndTransfer/CommitImage/CodeRevision |
| **`05` (new)** | `CALL $009B, #$B5` | NOT seen on-air |
| (default) | `CALL $0292, #$67` | error/fallback |

### Device-side ACK channel (`0x0B` XOR-encoded, NOT 8N1)

99.95% of `0x0B` packets validate as dimmer-ACKs. 5 bytes:
- `[0]` = `0x0B`
- `[1]` = sequence (cycles `0x02→04→06→08→0A→0C` between chunks)
- `[2]` = format ^ 0xFE (the actual status code)
- `[3]` = byte[1] ^ 0x26 (integrity check)
- `[4]` = format ^ 0x55 ^ 0xFE (redundant XOR-shadow of [2])

The corrected `format` byte is the **device's state code** during OTA:

| `format` | Phase | Inferred state |
|---|---|---|
| `0x2E` | Steady-state TransferData | "in-progress, idle" (89.7% of OTA) |
| `0xC1` | Pre-first-chunk | "ready / handshake" |
| `0xC2` | Around page wrap | "advancing page" |
| `0xEC` | Post-last-chunk | "committing / done" — **the one we watch for to confirm successful flash** |

Decoder rule: `firmware/src/cca/cca_decoder.h:309 try_parse_dimmer_ack`. The device emits 1 ACK every 25 ms regardless of bridge traffic. **Status-only — there is no per-chunk NACK or retransmit-request channel.**

### `0xC1+` response cluster — bridge-internal beacon, NOT device response

6-packet cluster (`0xC1, 0xC7, 0xCD, 0xD3, 0xD9, 0xDF`) fires every ~10.85 s for the full OTA window. Same body across all 6 types within a burst (6-way TDMA, like B1/B2/B3 chunks). Byte 6 is a decrementing counter `0x3F → 0x00 → wrap`; byte 11 toggles between `0x3F`/`0x3A`/`0x24`. **This is the bridge's master-presence beacon, NOT a device response.** Synth-TX from Nucleo doesn't need to emit these.

### EndTransfer / ResetDevice / CodeRevision / QueryDevice on-air

**Were NOT seen on-air during the captured 19-minute OTA.** The bridge fires BeginTransfer + chunk stream + ChangeAddressOffset and stops. The device's bootloader autonomously commits when it has the full firmware, then reboots.

**However** — bootloader sub-ops `0x04` and `0x05` (above) might be on-air-callable variants the bridge didn't exercise during the captured OTA. Worth probing during hardware test.

## What we know (PowPak HCS08 bootloader RE)

### Section structure (PowPakRelay434L1-53.ldf body, 102KB total)

- **Section A** = bootloader / platform code (`0x00..0xe92b`, 59,539 bytes)
- **Section B** = relay application (`0xe92c..end`, 42,977 bytes)
- Boundary marked by `Copyright 2008 Lutron Electronics` banner at `0x038a` (start of A) and `0xe92c` (start of B).
- LDF body bit-identical to the `.bin` loaded in BN/Ghidra — both sections present.

### Key bootloader code anchors (Section A offsets)

| Offset | What |
|---|---|
| `0x0000..0x001F` | 32-byte load-directive table (byte-identical between LMJ and RMJ; format not yet decoded) |
| `0x008AD` | **DeviceClass** = `16 08 02 01` (LMJ for this binary; the byte that distinguishes RMJ from LMJ) |
| `0x01a23` | **OTA sub-op dispatcher** (reads byte 6 of an inner buffer, branches to handlers via banked CALL) |
| `0x02d70..0x02d80` | **DeviceClass match function** (`CMP #$16; CMP #$08; CMP #$02; CMP #$01` with wildcard support) — **DEAD CODE: zero references anywhere in the binary** |
| `0x052c0` / `0x05714` | CCA `0xFA DE` sync detection (bootloader has its own CCA RX) |
| `0x05900..0x05f30` | Flash-write region — OTA chunk-receive flash programming |
| `0x05e78` / `0x05f1b` / `0x05f23` | FSTAT/FCMD writes (HCS08 flash control) |
| `0x49b2..0x49f1` | String table: `RMJ-16R-DV-B`, `RMJ-CCO1-24-B`, `RMJ-UNDEFINED` (Lutron hardware SKU names) |
| `0xbfb2` | FCDIV write (chip clock divider — only one per binary, runs at boot) |

### Chip family

Has `LDA $181E` (LAP register) used **143 times** in Section A — characteristic of HCS08 PA/LH/LL family with linear flash addressing. **Not** standard DZ/QE-family banked PPAGE-at-`$001F`. Page bytes in CALL instructions (0x2F, 0xF6, 0xB0, etc.) likely index into function-pointer tables resolved via LAP, not into 16KB physical flash banks.

### Trampolines (RAM-resident, populated at boot)

Three banked CALL trampolines at zero-page RAM addresses:
- `$009A` (used by sub-ops `0x01`, `0x03` and other call sites — 9 callers total)
- `$009B` (used by sub-ops `0x02`, `0x04`, `0x05` — 5 callers total)
- `$0292` (default fallback, 28 call sites — most often page byte `0x67`)

Each trampoline takes the page byte as an argument and dispatches to flash code. The exact handler addresses are not yet decoded (would require disassembling extended-flash regions and the RAM-init code that copies the trampolines from flash).

### Deadly silent: NO DeviceClass cross-check active in the bootloader

**Critical finding for the conversion attack.** The bootloader contains the hardware to compare an incoming DeviceClass against its own (the function at `0x2db1`), but **nothing calls it**. Verified:
- Zero JSR ext (`CD HH LL`) targeting `0x2d70..0x2d80`
- Zero banked CALL (`AC HH LL PP`) targeting it
- Zero relative branches reaching it
- Zero data references (function pointer tables) to it
- BN's xrefs view also reports zero

So the implied gate "the bootloader rejects cross-class flashes" is empirically absent. The OTA path has no active DeviceClass validation we've found.

### What's still unknown about the bootloader

1. **CRC32 / signature verification at OTA-end** — likely exists. The expected value source is unknown (could be derived from BeginTransfer payload `02 20 00 00 00 1F`, or computed at OTA-end and compared against a known good).
2. **NVPROT-imposed flash write-protection range** — `NVPROT byte = 0xCC`, but PA/LH chip family decoding of FPS bits is chip-specific. Worst case: bootloader region itself is write-protected. Best case: only specific small regions are protected (e.g., the load-directive table at `0x00..0x1F`).
3. **Sub-ops `0x04` and `0x05` semantics** — the bootloader handles them but we never saw them on-air. Hypothesis: they're EndTransfer / ResetDevice / CommitImage variants triggered by the bridge in conditions our captured OTA didn't exercise.
4. **Banked function-pointer table** — reading the RAM-init code that populates the trampolines would tell us where the actual handler functions live.

## What we know (live capture corpus + tooling)

### Capture artifacts on disk

- `/Users/alex/lutron-tools/data/captures/cca-ota-20260428-190439.rf.bin` (5.7 GB, gitignored) — 19-min IQ capture of Caseta Pro REP2 → DVRF-6L OTA at 2 Mhz sample rate
- `/Users/alex/lutron-tools/data/captures/cca-ota-20260428-190439.packets.jsonl` — every decoded packet (45,130 entries) over the OTA window 37s..1130s
- `/Users/alex/lutron-tools/data/captures/cca-pair-20260428-175549.rf.bin` + transcript — 547-packet pairing capture, same Caseta bridge
- `/Users/alex/lutron-tools/data/firmware/dvrf6l-v3.021.pff` (187,060 bytes) — source firmware that 90.7% of decoded chunks match byte-exact

### Tooling that landed in this PR

- `tools/ota-extract.ts --dump-all <jsonl>` — extends existing chunk reassembler to emit every decoded packet (all types) as JSONL for downstream analysis. **The JSONL is the corpus** — no other tool needed for control-packet decode.
- `tools/decrypt-lutron-firmware.sh` (existing) — bundle decryption with `6cba80b2bf3cf2a63be017340f1801d8`
- `tools/ldf-extract.py` (existing) — strips 0x80-byte LDF header to expose plaintext HCS08 image

### Updated reference docs

- [docs/protocols/cca.md §9 Firmware OTA Wire Protocol](../protocols/cca.md#9-firmware-ota-wire-protocol) — full rewrite to reflect on-air format (vs the old static-RE'd raw-bit description, which we now know is the host↔coproc IPC layer)
- [docs/firmware-re/cca-ota-live-capture.md](cca-ota-live-capture.md) — capture writeup with decoded sub-opcodes, packet layouts, ACK-channel state machine
- [docs/firmware-re/powpak.md](powpak.md) Bootloader-unknowns section — partial PowPak HCS08 RE findings
- [docs/firmware-re/caseta-cca-ota.md](caseta-cca-ota.md) — Phoenix EFR32 coproc dispatcher RE notes

### Updated TypeScript constants (`protocol/cca.protocol.ts`)

- New: `OTAOnAirSubOpcode` (`BEGIN_TRANSFER=0x00, CHANGE_ADDRESS_OFFSET=0x01, TRANSFER_DATA=0x02, POLL=0x03`)
- New: `OTADeviceAckState` (`IN_PROGRESS=0x2E, READY=0xC1, ADVANCING_PAGE=0xC2, COMMITTING=0xEC`)
- Renamed: `OTAOpcode → OTACoprocIPCOpcode` (with backward-compat alias) — these are the static-RE'd values, now correctly labeled as host↔coproc IPC, not on-air
- Removed wrong claim: `HOP_CHANNELS: 35` (it's single-channel)

## Hardware test plan (next session)

### Goal

Validate the conversion attack end-to-end: TX an LMJ `.ldf` body to a real RMJS device via Nucleo+CC1101, watch the device's ACK fmt byte transition through `0xC1 → 0x2E → 0xC2 → 0xEC`, then power-cycle and verify it pairs to an RA3 processor as LMJ.

### What's needed

| Item | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Nucleo H723ZG + CC1101 module | existing benchtop setup | the firmware in `firmware/src/cca/` already does runtime CCA TX/RX |
| RTL-SDR (RTL2832U/R820T2) | existing | for monitoring device ACKs |
| Target RMJS unit | TBD by user | factory-fresh or unpaired from any Vive controller |
| LMJ `.ldf` source firmware | already on disk | `data/designer-firmware/QuantumResi/.../powpak modules/PowPakRelay434L1-53.ldf` |
| LDF body extraction | `tools/ldf-extract.py` | strip 0x80 header → 102,516-byte plaintext body |
| Subnet to use | TBD | for a fresh attack, use a benign value like `0xEFFD` (matches our captured Caseta) or generate fresh; see "Attack params" below |

### Attack params

Constructing a valid TX requires picking values for fields that are normally bridge-side state:

- **Subnet** (bytes 3-4 of every packet) — `0xEFFD` works for our captured Caseta. For a fresh attack, the device may accept any subnet during initial pairing or factory state. Empirically test by trying multiple subnets.
- **Target device serial** (bytes 9-12) — read off the RMJS unit's product label.
- **BeginTransfer payload `02 20 00 00 00 1F`** — copy from our captured OTA verbatim. The trailing `0x1F` is the chunk size (31 bytes); leading 5 bytes' meaning is unknown but the captured value is known-good for at least the DVRF-6L case.
- **ChangeAddressOffset** — fire at every 64 KB page boundary in the LDF body. Payload bytes 16-19 = `00 PREV 00 NEW` where PREV/NEW are the page indices (0, 1, 2, ...).
- **TransferData chunks** — 31 bytes each from the LDF body, in order, with `addrLo` advancing by `0x1F` (31) per packet, wrapping at 64 KB.

### Step-by-step protocol

**Phase 2a — subnet recon (LANDED, awaiting hardware)**

The captured-OTA subnet `0xEFFD` is `Project.SubnetAddress` from a paired bridge's runtime DB. Per [cca-ota-live-capture.md §"On-air OTA wire protocol"](cca-ota-live-capture.md#byte-2-7-are-the-standard-cca-header-not-ota-specific), devices learn their subnet during pairing and filter incoming packets that don't match. **An unpaired RMJ never pairs (no host system addresses it via subnet) and an unpaired RMJS hasn't yet learned a subnet — both presumably fall back to the factory default `0xFFFF`.** That's hypothesis #1 to test.

`cca ota-begin <subnet> <serial> [dur]` — emits BeginTransfer packets at the captured cadence (~75 ms apart). Wired into the existing CCA TX engine via `CCA_CMD_OTA_BEGIN_TX`; uses the new builders in `firmware/src/cca/cca_ota_tx.h` (TDD against captured-on-air ground truth, all bytes byte-for-byte verified).

Hardware test procedure:

1. Read the target RMJ's serial off the product label (8 hex digits).
2. Power on RMJ (factory-fresh, never paired).
3. Start RTL-SDR capture at the runtime CCA channel (`433.602844 MHz`) and stream into a JSONL via `npx tsx tools/cca/ota-extract.ts --dump-all <out>.jsonl --capture <iq>` running in the background.
4. From the Nucleo shell: `cca ota-begin ffff <serial> 5` (TX BeginTransfer for 5 s with subnet `0xFFFF`).
5. Look for `type:0x0B` packets in the JSONL stream. The decoder (`firmware/src/cca/cca_decoder.h:309 try_parse_dimmer_ack`) XOR-decodes the format byte; we want `format=0xC1` (READY) to indicate the device entered OTA receive mode.
6. If no `0xC1` seen with `0xFFFF`: sweep candidates `0x0000`, `0xFFFE`, `0x82D7`, `0xEFFD`. Record which, if any, triggers `0xC1`.
7. If still no `0xC1`: the bootloader RX path may not accept on-runtime-channel packets in factory state at all. Next step: capture an actual ESN→RMJ transaction (if user has access to ESN) to see what address path the host uses for unpaired devices, OR drill into the bootloader's RX dispatcher (BN `0x92be` containing the FA DE sync check) to identify factory-state acceptance criteria.

**Phase 2b — full OTA TX (NOT YET BUILT — needs subnet recon result first)**

Adds `CCA_CMD_OTA_FULL_TX` that:
1. Receives an LMJ LDF body via the TCP stream protocol (one or more ~32 KB chunks)
2. Buffers it in Nucleo SRAM (~102 KB; well within RAM_D1 320 KB)
3. Runs the full BeginTransfer → 3,300× TransferData → ChangeAddrOff sequence at the captured cadence
4. Emits progress to UART log

Once Phase 2a confirms a working subnet, building Phase 2b is mechanical (the builders + chunk iterator are already done in `cca_ota_tx.h` — only the orchestration is missing).

**Phase 2c — monitor ACK transitions**

Watch device-side `0x0B` ACKs in real-time during the full OTA. Decode XOR via `try_parse_dimmer_ack` and watch the `format` byte:
- Expected start: `0xC1` (READY) — if NEVER seen, device didn't enter receive mode → BeginTransfer payload may need revisiting
- Expected mid-OTA: `0x2E` (IN_PROGRESS) — if stalls, decoder/CRC issue on our TX side
- Expected at page wraps: `0xC2` (ADVANCING_PAGE) — if missing, ChangeAddrOff format is wrong
- Expected at end: `0xEC` (COMMITTING) — **success signal**. If never seen, the device received chunks but bootloader rejected commit — likely CRC verification failure.

**Phase 3 — power-cycle and pair test**

After seeing `0xEC`, power-cycle the RMJ. Try to pair to an RA3 processor. If it pairs as LMJ, attack succeeded. **RMJS unit is not to be bricked — only test on RMJS once the protocol is fully validated against RMJ.**

### Decision tree at each stall point

| Stall | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| No `0xC1` after BeginTransfer | Subnet mismatch | Try subnet from RMJS's prior pairing (capture during pairing first); or sweep a few subnet values |
| `0xC1` but no `0x2E` after first chunk | Chunk format wrong | Verify CRC, byte ordering, sequence-byte advancement |
| `0x2E` but no `0xC2` at page boundary | ChangeAddrOff format wrong | Verify payload byte ordering, the 16-bit page index encoding |
| `0xC2` reached but no `0xEC` at OTA end | CRC verification failed at commit | The `02 20 00 00 00 1F` BeginTransfer payload may need a real value (not the captured DVRF-6L value); coproc RE needed (Phoenix EFR32, IPC opcode `0x2A` handler) |

### Risks & mitigations

- **Brick the device.** Mitigation: only target devices we're willing to lose. After successful BDM-recovery becomes possible (or deemed a viable backup), the risk drops.
- **HCS08 SEC bit blocks BDM read.** If the device boots and we can't read its flash post-attack, we can still erase + re-flash via BDM blind. So worst-case we lose factory data but not the device.
- **Subnet rejection at every value.** If the bootloader requires a SPECIFIC subnet (e.g., one matching its prior commissioning), we may need to capture the RMJS during pairing to learn its expected subnet. Easy enough to set up.
- **Signature/CRC at commit.** If the commit step verifies a signature over the body (not just CRC), we may need to RE the verification logic. The Phoenix EFR32 coproc IPC `0x2A` handler is the place to start (BN entry points at `0x08018c18` / `0x08018c98`; load the larger phoenix binary `_8003000-803FF08.bin`).

## Open questions (in rough priority order)

1. **Will the device subnet-filter our packets?** Empirical: try a few subnet values, watch for any ACK at all. Highest-priority unknown.
2. **What does the leading 5 bytes of BeginTransfer payload mean?** May affect commit success. RE Phoenix EFR32 coproc IPC handler.
3. **Sub-ops `0x04`/`0x05` — when does the bridge send them?** May be required for commit. If our OTA stalls at `0x2E → no 0xEC`, this is the suspect.
4. **NVPROT flash-protection range** — does it cover Section A? If yes, can't update bootloader. Empirically test by attempting to write to Section A region first; observe via SDR whether device acknowledges.
5. **Does the RMJ→LMJ DeviceClass change persist across power cycle?** Required for the device to pair as LMJ after commit. Tested implicitly by pair-test step 3.

## Anchors for the next RE session (if needed before hardware)

If hardware test stalls and deeper RE is needed:

- **Phoenix EFR32 coproc IPC `0x2A` handler** — load `data/firmware/phoenix-device/coprocessor/phoenix_efr32_8003000-803FF08.bin` (249KB, the larger binary — Ghidra currently has the smaller 117KB one) into Ghidra. The 5 dispatcher functions identified earlier (`0x080190a8`, `0x080192d4`, `0x08019490`, `0x08019724`, `0x080199d8`) construct outgoing packets; the data structures they reference live past the current Ghidra segment's end.
- **PowPak banked CALL targets** — the trampoline at RAM `$009A`/`$009B` is populated at boot from flash. Find the RAM-init code (`memcpy`-style copy from flash to `0x009A`) to learn what handler addresses the page bytes index into. Once decoded, load the relevant flash region into Ghidra and disassemble the TransferData / sub-op-04 / sub-op-05 handlers.

- `project-powpak-pairing-rules.md` — RMJ→ESN, RMJS→Vive, LMJ→RA2/3/HW family rules
- `feedback-powpak-is-pure-cca.md` — PowPaks are 433 MHz CCA only, not QS-Link
- `project-designer-doesnt-ota-cca.md` — Designer only updates CCX; CCA OTA is host-system-driven
